This package provides a set of tools to build AIs for your project. The key systems included are:
- Locomotion system configured for humanoids and with a simple humanoid mesh
- Core infrastructure (FastName system, generic Singleton, AI sensors and Blackboard)
- Flexible Finite State Machine (FSM) Architecture
- Hybrid Goal Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) system capable of running multiple goals in parallel
- Support for FSM or Behaviour Tree based GOAP actions
- Support for standalone FSMs or Behaviour Trees
- Example scenes and behaviours demonstrating wandering, chasing, gathering resources, looking at points of interest and interacting with objects.
